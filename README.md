# Gun-Violence-Exploration

Imbedded deep into the social fabrics of the nation of United States is the right to bear and keep arms. However, the relationship between guns and people has been getting more and more complicated in  modern times, with stories about gun violence permeating media outlets.

In this study, we want to visualize:

(1)	Density of gun violence in 2018, with maps showing Total Number of Incidents, Home Invasions, Defensive Use, and  Unintentional Shootings. The data was downloaded from http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/

(2)	Support of Gun control based on: education, income, gender, political party, and race. The dataset was taken from Pew Research Center, using survey responses from the survey 'America's Complex Relationship with Guns', conducted from March-April 2017.

(3)	Mass shootings
